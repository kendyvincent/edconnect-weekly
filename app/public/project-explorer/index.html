        <lh>Project 1</lh>
        <li>Name: Hyperbolic Triangle Groups by Paul Stommer</li>
        <li>Description: This paper will be on hyperbolic reflections and triangle groups. We will compare hyperbolic reflection groups to Euclidean reflection groups. The goal of this project is to give a clear exposition of the geometric, algebraic, and number theoretic properties of Euclidean and hyperbolic reflection groups.</li>

        <li>Name: Parallelizing unit test execution on GPU by James Haddison</li>
        <li>Description: Software testing is an important stage of the software development life cycle. However, the test execution is time-consuming and costly. To accelerate the test execution, researchers have applied several methods to run the testing in parallel. One method of parallelizing the test execution is by using a GPU machine to distribute test case inputs among several threads running in parallel. </li>

        <li>Name: Refactoring an existing code base to improve modularity and quality by Cody Baxter</li>
        <li>Description: Code written in modern programming languages (such as Java) can be almost impossible to understand and maintain due to poor design and coding practices used during its development. Instead of redeveloping the entire code from scratch (which is an expensive and time-consuming proposition), typically a series of refactoring steps are applied to make the software better in terms of both design and coding quality, which translates to better user experience because the maintainability and scalability of the application is increased. </li>
